    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Alaina Hicks, AJ for short. I am a SAHM raising 2 awesome kiddos. My
      life's work is to raise awareness about Autism. I do this by allowing my journey with my son, Cannon to be on
      full display. I am from Chicago, IL affectionately known as the "Windy City". Home to the Monsters of the
      Midway, the Chicago White Sox and the 2016 World Series champion team, Chicago Cubs. In my spare time I enjoy
      family, fitness, dining and finding the best plant based restaurants as well as traveling. My past work with the
      military has granted me opportunities to travel to Alaska, Hawaii, Japan and throughout Europe (Italy, Germany,
      the Netherlands and Switzerland). My goal is to travel all 50 states as well as visit a number of countries and
      islands.</p>

    <p>I enjoy Customer Service, being of assistance to someone as well as interaction which is how I found my love for
      Hospitality Management
      with the Marriott brand. I have worked in Non-Profit and Education, teaching Pre-Kindergarten for 4 years as
      well as Middle School SPED with a focus on students with Autism. I decided to take a pivot in the workfoce after
      being introduced to Full Stack Web Development by a friend. Although it's very challenging and puts me way
      outside of my comfort zone I am along for the ride. Buckle up!</p>
