## Purpose
The purpose of the assignment is to create a mobile responsive portfolio that is functional and deployable.

## Goal
My goal is to provide a portfolio that is visually appealing. That allows the reader to learn a bit more about me and also allows the viewer to see my work, my strengths, weaknesses and to understand my goals moving forward. 

## Description
Provided is my personal portfolio that includes a little about myself, my latest work including my first and second group project, my Resume and my contact information.

## Challenges and Successes  
My biggest challenge is making my portfolio look the way I envision it. Choosing the perfect background that is subtle, easy on the eyes and not a distraction. I had success with condensing my portfolio and continuing to implement things that I have learned over the course of the class.

## Motivation
To show a complete portfolio that showcases my work and who I am.
